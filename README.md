## 🔍 Key Insights
- Apps with higher review counts generally have higher install numbers  
- Free apps dominate the Play Store and receive more installs than paid apps  
- App size has minimal impact on install count  
- Sentiment polarity shows a positive relationship with app ratings  
- Popularity does not always guarantee positive user sentiment

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how application features and user sentiment influence app success on the
Google Play Store. While installs and reviews strongly correlate, sentiment analysis provides deeper
insights into actual user satisfaction beyond ratings alone.
